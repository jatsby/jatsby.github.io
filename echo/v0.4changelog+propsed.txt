Jatsby Framework v0.4
0.3 -> 0.4 Changelog
October 25, 2014 - October 29, 2014

- Added "Fonts" and "Reset" sections to template's mobile.css
- Added "-wekbit-font-size-adjust: 100%;" to Reset section to prevent
  browsers from adjusting the font size when orientation changes
- Added @media to Desktop breakpoint to allow for quick testing of :hover 
  effects in split windows (which are inevitably less than 1201px on many screen sizes)
- Renamed "Meta" section in template's index.html to "Meta / SEO" for clarity
- Corrected spelling error ("breakpoint" in CSS files)


Proposed (didn't quite make it into v0.4, but on the books for a future release)

- Added some modules
	- headers
	- footers
	- graphs
	- buttons
	
- Search Engine Optimization
	- Better than it is with the HTML Meta tags, if possible
	
I think it would be best to have one HTML and CSS file pair for ALL of the modules of the framework.
Like a catalog, which should be much easier than having to find and open buttons.html and buttons.css, then
moving on to the next pair, like headers.html and headers.css, etc.

The idea is that the Jatsby Framework is made up of two parts
	- The template (which people will use for the code of their webpages)
	- The catalog (where all of the premade code is stored)
	
	The idea is that people copypasta from the catalog things they want, into the template.
	
	Keep lato.css separate, so all 100-900 weights are available to try out when making the webpage. When the page is finished,
	the @import for lato.css can be replaced with direct code (@font-face) from the CSS file.
