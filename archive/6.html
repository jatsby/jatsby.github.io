			<div id="content">I don’t know if anyone reading this can say they’ve been in a serious car accident, but just today I can be added to that list.  It was probably the scariest thing I’ve experienced, and I wouldn’t wish it on anybody.
<br><br>
I walked away relatively unscathed, just some minor bruising where the seatbelt kept me in place while it happened.  It was a near-death experience, but it doesn’t feel that way… At least not yet.  It’s made me realize that anyone can die at any time, there’s no guarantee I’ll be home for Christmas this year.  I know it’s probably hard to really grasp this concept if you haven’t had a near-death experience, but really I’m just as likely to die as anyone else (generally-speaking), and it shouldn’t take a near-death experience to make me feel really grateful I’m alive to write this.  Every single one of us should live each day like it’s our last (sans doing anything rash like robbing a bank or otherwise “going out with a bang”) and be glad we could make it as far as we have in life.
<br><br>
I’ve never been much for birthdays.  I don’t like people knowing when my birthday is, because then I get attention for it.  I don’t really like attention, and I don’t really think turning nineteen is much to celebrate.  I still feel that way, but I look at things a bit differently, now.  Now instead of seeing no days worth celebrating (namely birthdays), I see <em>every</em> day as a day to celebrate being alive.
<br><br>
I’m not going to go all religious, here- I’m an Atheist.  But this really doesn’t have anything to do with religion, anyway.  Being an Atheist, I don’t believe in an afterlife (of course not <em>all</em> Atheists feel the same way).  I really wish there was an afterlife, though, but I’ve always been the “just the facts, ma’am” type, and there’s yet to be any real credible scientific evidence to suggest an afterlife.
<br><br>
Anyway, the point is that what happened to me today could happen to anyone at any time, hell if we’re speaking statistically, I’m probably <em>less</em> likely to be in another car accident compared to those who have yet to experience one.  And some of you never will.  But others, others will <em>die</em>.  It’s cryptic, sure, but that shouldn’t mean we should take a “fuck it, I’m going to die eventually, anyway” approach to life.  Rather, we should do just the opposite, live like we could die at any time.  Because we could.
<br><br>
I just haven’t figured out how to live like that, yet.  I think it means something different for each of us, and so I’m not going to tell you to party hard and study harder, because that might not be <em>living</em> to you. It's certainly not for me.</div>
