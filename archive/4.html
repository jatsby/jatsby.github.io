			<div id="content">Pretend for a moment that your 3.2 GPA <em>is</em> good enough to graduate with honors.  It feels good, right?  It’s not the reality, but it could be.  We <em>could</em> lobby Michelman to lower the Honors Graduation GPA Requirement to, say, 3.2… 
<br><br>
But that’s a lot of work. 
<br><br>
On top of that, the outcome is far from guaranteed.  We could spend a lot of time researching other universities’ protocols, building a strong argument, and presenting it to the Honors brass- and it could all be for naught.  It would be so much easier if we just stopped caring.  So let’s.
<br><br>
Honors is a pretty sweet gig.  Because of Honors, I never, <em>ever</em> touch my SGA print credit (nor do I have to shell out per-page once that’s gone), and I always manage to score the classes I want.  I have special advisors whom I’ve never had to wait more than two minutes to see.  I even have access to a lounge full of like-minded people, which conveniently doubles as a comedy club when the right people are in the room (you know who you are).  Further, I’m sure being in Honors will come in handy should I ever have a brush with UPD or Student Conduct.
<br><br>
The only con to being in honors is that revered Colloquium class, but it’s over now.  My debt’s been paid, all our debts have been paid.
<br><br>
None of these wonderful privileges will go away if our GPAs lurch behind the 3.4 mark.  In fact, for many of us, our GPAs have never even been that high.  Even for those who can easily manage the 3.4, ask yourself: why is graduating with honors <em>so</em> important?
<br><br>
It’s so you can say you graduated with honors.  Employers don’t particularly hate it.  In fact, they like it a lot!  Anything that makes you stand out is good, of course. That’s pretty much common knowledge.  Still, I don’t believe graduating with honors is as big a deal today as it was fifty, twenty, or even five years ago.  The rise of the internship has rendered something as career-irrelevant and unspecific as “graduated with honors” near-weightless when compared to “interned with Google”, “volunteered with Ospreys for Jax”, or “researched an undergraduate thesis (specific to my major)”. 
<br><br>
We shouldn’t be worried about our GPAs so much, because the magic number isn’t 3.4; it’s 3.0.  Graduating with honors shouldn’t be anywhere near the top of anyone’s priority list, at least not ahead of scoring internships, starting clubs, making new friends and (perhaps most importantly) enjoying college while it lasts.  When you think about it, isn’t that what honors should <em>really</em> be about?		
<br><br>
I plan on graduating without honors, and I’m totally okay with that.</div>
