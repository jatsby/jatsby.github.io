<br><br>
But you see, your entire article is entirely in support of moving away from a one-size-fits-all honors requirement, because as you say, Honors is more than just these numbers. Honors is that relationships with your advisors, the friendships you make with other honors students, that internship with google, that volunteering you did, and that research or thesis you did. How can you put a number on these experiences? The truth is that you can’t. A number isn’t what makes an honors student. 
<br><br>
If there is change in the system, people won’t have to have the mindset of having graduating with honors as their top priority (if anyone has that mindset already). No one would have to cushion their GPA with “easy A” classes, instead they can focus on what they are passionate about and let their character and experiences speak for themselves. A change would allow people’s merit outshine any GPA they have. 
<br><br>
As to your assertion that the mark of graduating with honors is “near-weightless” when compared to other marks, I refute that statement as outlandish! Yes, there are some majors such as Computer Science where an internship in the field would be more valuable than that “graduated with honors” mark, that certainly does not hold true to all or I would argue almost all cases. To anyone who plans on furthering their education (which is most people) with a master’s or doctorate degree, that mark can be invaluable. Will my master’s/doctorate program care that I interned with a Florida Senator? Probably they won’t care that much (if I were applying for a job, that would be another matter), but will they care that I graduated with honors? Chances are, yes they will. 
<br><br>
To your other points, first, club involvement isn’t that big of a deal (even when you’re in leadership positions in a club, though there are exceptions to this), especially when this involvement is simply volunteering that doesn’t have much if anything to do with your chosen field. If someone reviewing your graduate school application see that, I would bet that most people would think “great, but how does that let me know s/he’ll complete quality work”. And research (I’m including a thesis when I talk about this section) already should be directly tied to honors. Research is something that is a mark of honors students, and doing student research should be a goal that leads to being an honors student, not the other way around.

You’re right though; lobbing Michelman to change any Honors requirements is going to be a lot of work. Not only do you have to get him onboard, but once he is for it, you have to get a council at the university level to approve it before it can be enacted, with maybe more involvement being required before the Honors Program would see any changes. That does sound like a lot of work to me. But never forget what Edmund Bruke said about evil, all that is takes is for good men do nothing. I don’t know what exactly what I have to do, but I for one, am going to do something.</div>
