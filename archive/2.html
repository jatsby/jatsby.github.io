			<div id="content">When the night scene falls on downtown Annapolis, children are put to bed and instruments are rustled awake. Street performers line the sidewalks like the lights illuminating them, and the air is filled with the hum and jingle of guitars and percussion. Voices fill the empty spaces the bands fail to cover, and the capital stands guard at the end of Main Street, shadows from the strings and leather cast on it from the bustling road below. This is my concert; the curb a stage, footsteps the applause, and the instrumentalists the main event.

As I walked past a particular group posted in front of a closed jewelry store, I took a moment to stop and listen closer. It was a two person posse, one with a large bongo drum, the other with a worn but genuine acoustic guitar. The performer with the bongo held the beat while the guitarist strummed through chord after chord, fusing lyrics with a sound that took me to mid-afternoon beach walks in St. Augustine. The lyrics were sung with a soft, nasally voice, one you might hear at a bar on Christmas eve night. The drummer would add flare via his own voice to support the soft tones of the first, and would fill empty bars with extra beats to reel in Naptown wanderers.

I took a seat on a nearby bench and let their music become the white noise to the luminosity ambivalent amongst the shops around me. The head-bopping bands, the refraction of headlights against shop windows, the crisp night breeze, the voice of glasses proposing toasts, creating percussion of their own; it was another Saturday night on the harbor. A place where music swallows exhaust pipes, artists direct traffic, and sounds become strangers we pass by on the sidewalk. A place where a guitar doesn't pull just one string, but six, and the pedestrians, holding their ice creams, beers, and another's hand, become the puppets performing for the sail boats still drifting on the Chesapeake Bay. This is a concert, and no matter what the weather is, the show must go on. And what is a show, without a little Maryland music.</div>
