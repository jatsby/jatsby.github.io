			<div id="content">Osprey Confessions seemed like a good idea at the time. I mean, what’s not to love? It’s the only place on the Internet where people can anonymously make public to their fellow Ospreys things they’d never reveal in person. It’s a release. Telling secrets is fun, and it tends to leave one feeling pretty accomplished. Still, I believe Osprey Confessions is on borrowed time, and destined to fail. 
<br><br>
I’ve never actually posted on Osprey Confessions, so haters gonna hate, but like probably most of you reading this, I do frequent it, and for two reasons. First, I want to see if I’m the object of someone’s affection (I also check out Osprey Crushes for this reason). Second, I want to see what kinds of interesting things people have to say about themselves or others. I’m sure there are other websites where one can post secrets anonymously. In fact I have a particular one in mind, but the name escapes me. Anyway, what makes Osprey Confessions special is also, I believe, its Achilles Heel. 
<br><br>
Who cares if two people had sex in a car in a parking garage somewhere? What makes it of interest is that it’s in fact two people I know, in a car I’ve actually been in, in a parking garage I can see from my two o’clock class. That’s not to say I’ll be keeping an eye on said parking garage, rather I mean this: other peoples’ secrets are boring, but the secrets of people you know, or people your friends know? That’s interesting. 
<br><br>
The problem with this is that the “secret pool” if you will, is very finite. As of this writing, around 3,000 people like (and therefore probably follow) Osprey Confessions. With around 17,000 students at UNF, even if they all liked Osprey Confessions and contributed to the “secret pool”, eventually the (good) confessions would run out. 
<br><br>
Arguably, we can already see that… Osprey Confessions, I think, was a lot more interesting a few months ago. Nowadays, things like “icebreakers” and jokes fill up the page, proof that yes, the secrets are running out. And what then, when there are no more secrets to tell? Will the page, thousands strong, whither away? 
<br><br>
I think one of two things will happen. Either the “Admin” will continue in her line of work, posting virtually anything, confession or not, without discrimination; or she’ll recognize the impending demise and retire the page gracefully. I’d imagine she’d reveal her identity, too, if it came to that. That would probably be the best way for the Osprey Confessions to go out. If she opts for the former, however, dragging it out, “beating a dead horse” if you will… I can’t really say for sure, but I would surmise that a lot of people would feel negatively towards the page, there would be an ever-increasing number of confessions just to complain about the dying quality of the confessions. People would probably “unlike” the page. At that point, the Admin might be in a less-desirable position to reveal herself. 
<br><br>
Of course, I can’t say for sure what will happen in the months or years to come. All I know is that all good things must come to an end someday, and the Admin would be wise to have her exit strategy in place for when that day comes.</div>
