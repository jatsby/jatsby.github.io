seriously, count them; just the essentials. Clothes, A bed to sleep in, a fridge to keep food in, maybe a 
microwave to cook with and utensils to eat with, a desk to study at, a desk lamp, a bike or car or some 
form of transportation, and probably the most commonly used: a laptop and phone. In some countries 
you’re fortunate to have the first two, but everything after that are the only things a person (in our 
society, anyways) could ever need.

<br><br>
Did you feel kind of good about yourself, like you unlocked some secret achievement and transcended to a new level of cool?
<br><br>
Like perhaps you were really starting to "find yourself" like you'd been promised all throughout your dorky high school days, back when geek-chic was just geek?

Well, slow down racehorse because here comes a news flash...

I walked away relatively unscathed, just some minor bruising where the seatbelt kept me in place while it happened.  It was a near-death experience, but it doesn’t feel that way… At least not yet.</div>

				<div id="content">A response to "Graduating Without Honors": 
	<br><br>
	But you see, your entire article is entirely in support of moving away from a one-size-fits-all honors requirement, because as you say, Honors is more than just these numbers. Honors is that relationships with your advisors, the friendships you make with other honors students, that internship with google, that volunteering you did, and that research or thesis you did. How can you put a number on these experiences? The truth is that you can’t. A number isn’t what makes an honors student. </div>

				<div id="content">The year is 1969, Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong are 238,900 miles away from home and less than a decade ago it was only a dream. In the next 41 months, there would be ten more Americans to explore the barren surface of the moon for a total of six landings. Then, in 1972, they stop. Man has never, and may never, travel farther, and since then, our flag has faded to white, bleached by the sun: somewhat of a metaphor for what many suggest is America's drive for progress today.</div>
