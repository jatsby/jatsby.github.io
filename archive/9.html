			<div id="subtitle">(And if you mean it, fuck you)</div>
			<div id="content">Ever been called a hipster by your friends when you, say, recommended a band they hadn't heard of? Wore some thick-rimmed glasses and kind of pulled them off?
<br><br>
Did you feel kind of good about yourself, like you unlocked some secret achievement and transcended to a new level of cool?
<br><br>
Like perhaps you were really starting to "find yourself" like you'd been promised all throughout your dorky high school days, back when geek-chic was just geek?
<br><br>
Well, slow down racehorse because here comes a news flash...
<br><br>
Being called a hipster IS NOT a compliment.
<br><br>
It's just not. Let that sink in. 
<br><br>
Here's the thing: you can buy all of your clothes at Urban Outfitters, have the most obscure taste in music, drink more PBR than anyone you know, AND ride a fixed gear and still not be a hipster.
<br><br>
Wait, what? How's that possible? 
<br><br>
Having weird taste makes you eccentric (and probably a downer at parties), but the trademark of the true hipster is being a colossal asshole who happens to also share these tastes. A hipster takes his/her eccentric interests and hobbies and pumps them through a hipper-than-thou complex to produce a particular breed of despicably pretentious bastard. To make this point more clear, here's an example scenario:
<br><br>
Regular kid: Just downloaded some new Coldplay songs, can't wait to listen to them!
<br><br>
Hip kid: They're not my favorite band, but I respect your taste.
<br><br>
Hipster: Ugh, Coldplay? So not deck. Somebody hold my Starbucks while I smoke some cigarettes and post on my tumblr about what a waste you are.
<br><br>
That's obviously an extreme example, but I think it can be used to outline the basic mechanics of what it means to be a hipster. This includes the rejection and degradation of the interests of people who are different than them, followed by self-validation (frequently fueled by social media). And that's the fundamental force that makes a hipster an asshole, is the fact that they are so caught up in creating an image for themselves that they somehow lose respect for the opinions of others.
<br><br>
So, if you've recently found yourself reading through Pitchfork articles and frequently saying the word "post-modern," don't fret. You're really only a hipster if you've been an asshole about it, which is accomplished through regarding your tastes as superior to other people's and, by the same stroke, demeaning the things that they hold dear. This, of course, could be easily remedied by sitting down for a big slice of humble pie and remembering that the interests and eccentricities of others are reflections of their unique and valuable perspectives, and we should really just be fucking grateful for each other since we're really all just stuck out here together in a meaningless abyss, and if we can't learn to get along, then I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL IS WORTH LIVING FOR.
<br><br>
Moral of the story? Don't call people hipsters, unless you mean to call them out for being real assholes. Furthermore, don't call people assholes because that's mean and you'll eventually alienate everyone you love.
<br><br>
Peace, friends.
