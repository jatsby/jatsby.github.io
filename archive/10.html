			<div id="content">How many things do you need? A better question may be how many things do you even use? No, seriously, count them; just the essentials. Clothes, A bed to sleep in, a fridge to keep food in, maybe  a microwave to cook with and utensils to eat with, a desk to study at, a desk lamp, a bike or car or some form of transportation, and probably the most commonly used: a laptop and phone. In some countries you’re fortunate to have the first two, but everything after that are the only things a person (in our society, anyways) could ever need.
<br><br> 
Try this; out of all the crap in your room, what individual things could one steal and you not know it be missing for at least three days. I’m willing to bet at least half of the things you own. Those things are not essential (apart from the first-aid kit, you may want to keep that, Rambo). For one thing they clutter your room, but more pressingly they become arbitrary stops on your daily schedule and thus complicate your life. A great life is not the result of many possessions, but the result of many experiences, and it can be hard to get out there, do it all, and live life if we are so busy doing nothing but building your collection of stuff.  Now don’t get me wrong, things can be nice. I’m not saying go and get rid of everything you love and hold dear, nor am I advocating you to kill all that is fun. Don’t part with sentiment. But also don’t make everything sentimental. I love some things too that I may never part with and I can’t even speak from great experience because I too still have lots of things I don’t need, but it’s an idea and lifestyle I’ve been toying with for a while now, and the more minimalist I become, the simpler my life becomes. In fact, I think it gives me a greater appreciation for everything else: my relationships with people, health, knowledge, nature, and becoming a better person in general. It’s actually quite therapeutic and it feels very natural. 
<br><br>
Technology doesn’t necessarily hinder the experience. You may have noticed I included in my list of essentials a laptop and phone, and I’ll tell you why. For starters, you wouldn’t be reading this without one of those… or probably have a job (you’re welcome). 
<br><br>
Sixty years ago, the word “minimalist” would have been a fancy word  “poor”, however, with today’s technology, one can own little but still have a lot. Smart phones are like modern Swiss army knives. They’re more than just phones, they’re pen and paper, a compass and map, a camera, an audio recorder, a television and radio, a library of books, THE INTERNET, and the list goes on. So you can see how one device acting as many can dramatically advance the minimalist effort like never before. With that said, if not used sparingly, it defeats the entire purpose of the lifestyle. It should be used when needed, like everything else. 
<br><br>
I myself am still adjusting to the transition and although I have a long road ahead of me of waning off of nonessentials, I look forward to every day I am less connected with things, and more connected with life.</div>
