			<div id="content">The year is 1969, Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong are 238,900 miles away from home and less than a decade ago it was only a dream. In the next 41 months, there would be ten more Americans to explore the barren surface of the moon for a total of six landings. Then, in 1972, they stop. Man has never, and may never, travel farther, and since then, our flag has faded to white, bleached by the sun: somewhat of a metaphor for what many suggest is America's drive for progress today. 
<br><br>
It seems, since then, America has started making decisions solely on their immediate monetary benefit. In 1972 Nixon decided space exploration was not in America’s best interest. Lunar missions were too expensive and it was time to attend to more Earthly needs. To be fair going to the moon did seem unnecessary, but Kennedy put it best when he said, “We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard…” Dreams were bigger back then and facing challenges was the American way. We wouldn’t buy our way out, we wouldn’t fight our way out, we would invent our way out. It was in our nature, and still is, but it’s something were beginning to forget. 
<br><br>
So where did it all our motivation go? The best answer: we have ignored our instinct to seek progress because of complacency. In only the last half-century, we have shifted from being a lead producer, to a lead consumer, and not just of simple goods but also technology, energy, and even ideas. We live in a world of outsourcing, and it’s becoming a problem. Since the most recent shutdown of NASA, American astronauts have been piggybacking trips to the international space station on Russian shuttles, and that too may soon come to a complete halt. An even bigger problem is energy. We currently depend on vast amounts of oil from foreign suppliers who, on a whim, have the power to adjust prices or even cut us off completely. One day in the not so distant future, we will run out of oil, foreign and domestic, (if we don’t melt the ice caps first) and dependency on clean, renewable energy will become necessary. Why not solve this problem sooner than later? Because it is cheaper? Whatever the cause, lately, America has made little revolutionary jumps in ingenuity, largely due to complacency with the back seat. 
<br><br>
Why is any of today’s research important? When quantum mechanics was first discovered, people griped that it was just physicists burning tax money, but it was quantum mechanics that provided the entire foundation of our technological revolution. In an interview with Stephen Colbert, Neil deGrasse Tyson stressed the importance of science and engineering. “Today you hear people saying ‘why are we spending money up there when we’ve got problems on Earth?’ – People don’t connect the time delay between the frontier of scientific research and how that’s going to transform your life later down the line. All they want is a quarterly report that’s shows a product that comes out of it. That is so short sided, that that’s the beginning of the end of your culture.” 
<br><br>
So how can we fix all this? Education is a good start. Increasingly, STEM majors (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) are beginning to grow, but it’s a flame we have to continue to fan. Norman Augustine, renowned icon in engineering, claims that nearly 70% of all engineering graduates in the US are foreign born and many of them are likely to return home with their education. It’s no surprise considering the amount of emphasis our society gives to engineering. So we must give it more. Expose the youth to our engineering problems and the people who are working to solve them. Today, the only publicly known engineer is Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, whose character, by the way, is inspired by real life engineer renegade Elon Musk, CTO/CEO of SpaceX, founder of Tesla Motors, and co-founder of PayPal. We need to put these types of people in the public eye and fix the way we look at engineers and engineering. There are real problems in our nation that need solving, and at this point, engineers can’t just go and fix them on their own. We, as a nation, have to choose to face these challenges first, support the cause, and reclaim our position as the forerunners of progress.</div>
