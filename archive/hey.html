			<div id="title">Better Than a Blog!</div>
			<div id="subtitle">"Blog" Doesn't Really Do Us Justice</div>
			<div id="content">Archive's like a blog, only better. Think of us as a cross between a blog, a news site, and a forum- wait, hear us out!
<br><br>
It's a place where anyone (at the University of North Florida) can publish any of their writing- from a romance novel, to a bit of poetry, to a good old-fashioned rant.
<br><br>
Archive is for the few truly-passionate writers out there who want to publicize their work in a setting that's neither critical nor chaotic- and you can even publish anonymously.

			<div id="title">The More, the Merrier</div>
			<div id="subtitle">From the Interesting to the Scandalous</div>
			<div id="content">Archive's based on the theory that innovation increases with competition.<br> The more businesses there are, the more innovation there'll be.
<br><br>
Likewise, the more submissions we get from the good people of the world, the better our content will be. This also means that, over time, getting published on Archive will become evermore-difficult.</div>

				<div id="title">Without Further Adieu</div>
				<div id="subtitle">Send In Your Writing!</div>
				<div id="content">Submissions can be emailed to us at hey@Archive.co in any format you wish, from .docx to .pdf to .pages!
<br><br>
Submission is no guarantee of publication. We don't have official guidelines for submissions, but as long as what you have has some passion to it, we won't be too picky. 
<br><br>
Each bit of writing that we get is personally reviewed by a real-life human, so your submission won't be published immediately. We usually update the site with new content at least once per day.</div>

	<br><br>
	If we happen to feature an article that you're particularly passionate about, you can send us a "letter to the editor", your opinionated response to an article, the same way you'd submit writing- just send it to <span class="email">hey@jatsby.co</span>. We might even publish your response alongside our regular content.</div>
